                Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment
                that demands
                fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated, thus, everyone's task is
                unique as his
                specific opportunity to implement it.

                <p>
                    Having a website means customers are always able to find you - anytime, anywhere. Even outside of
                    business hours, your
                    website continues to find and secure new customers. It offers the user convenience as they can
                    access
                    the information
                    they need in the comfort of their own home, with no added pressure to buy. Plus, as most companies
                    nowadays have their
                    own website, there's every chance you could be losing customers to your competitors by staying
                    offline.

                    A developer community generally defined is a group of developers gathered in a place to achieve a
                    common goal.The
                    purpose of a developer community and the pieces that build the community puzzle are complex and
                    different for each
                    unique case. Developer communities usually stem from a general problem of information silos, senior
                    developers spending
                    their days answering questions rather than coding, or product teams creating things that their
                    communities and customers
                    don't actually need or want.
